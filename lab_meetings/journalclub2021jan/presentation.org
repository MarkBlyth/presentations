  #+begin_comment
State the goal of choosing this paper:

    * Quite an interesting paper as it introduces some rather mathematical concepts in a biologically relevant way
    * I'll try to do the same:
      * To highlight some of the rich dynamics one might see in a multiscale system
      * To explain why these multiscale dynamics are interesting biologically
  #+end_comment

* 1 Intro
** Why multiple timescales?
Biological systems consist of interacting parts operating over many timescales
\vfill
    * Accurate models need a combination of slowly and rapidly changing variables
    * Doing anything useful with these models requires ways of understanding timescale interactions
\vfill
Simplest example
\[\dot{x} = f(x,y)\]
\[\dot{y} = \varepsilon g(x,y)\]

** Subsystems and timescale separations
   
   * Consider \(\varepsilon\to0\)
   * Let \(\tau = \varepsilon t\)

** COMMENT NOTES
   
   * Fast subsystem is an ODE
   * y variable becomes a parameter to the ODE
   * Dynamics of the fast subsystem can be investigated by looking at the bifurcations it undergoes when y changes

   * Slow subsystem is a DAE

** COMMENT NOTES
   * V models the membrane potential of an electrophysiologically active pancreatic beta cell
     * *Fast variable*
   * I_Ca is the calcium current
     * Assumed to be very fast to change, so we replace it with its steadystate value
   * K_dr is the rectifying (downstroke) current
     * It needs its dynamics including to model spikes, as the spikes arise as a result of the slower downstroke / rectifying current
     * *We again replace it with a steady-state value, simply to get a planar system*
   * KATP is the ATP-modulated potassium current, used by cells to sense glucose metabolism
     * We can get ATP oscillations in beta cells, but that's not what we're interested in here, so assume it has a constant conductance
   * Ks is another potassium ion channel
     * This is our channel of interest, a slow-activating ion channel
     * *Slow variable*
   * I_l is the leakage, all other ion movements

   * No sodium currents in mouse beta cells, so none in our model either

   * Plot shows a simulation of the model
   * Fast variable (voltage) shown on top, with square-wave dynamics
   * Slow variable (ionic current) shown on bottom, with sawtooth dynamics
** Planar dynamics

Behaviours shown are typical of slow-fast systems
   * States settle to equilibrium of fast subsystem
   * Equilibrium evolves, disappears, reappears through changes in slow subsystem

** COMMENT NOTES

Explain nullclines, etc.
*Mention critical manifold*

* 3 Bursting
** Higher dimensions
   * Higher-dimensional models can also show relaxation oscillations, plus more
   * Unlike the planar case, the fast subsystem attractor might no longer satisfy \(f(x,y)=0\)
\vfill
Consider our neuron model again, without the steadystate assumption on \(I_{Kdr}\)

\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -(I_{Ca} + I_{Kdr} + I_{KATP} + I_{Ks} + I_l) \\ \nonumber
\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{s_\infty(V) - s}{\tau_s} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{n_\infty(V) - n}{\tau_n} \nonumber
\end{align}

** Bursting
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: plain
   :END:
Our new model produces bursting oscillations!

** COMMENT NOTES
   
   * Voltage-like variable alternates between a fast-spiking active phase, and a quiescent rest phase
   * Our fast Kdr current follows the same behaviour
   * The slow s-current changes very gradually, at a much slower rate
   * Changes in the s-current / slow subsystem are what drive the transition between active and resting phases

** COMMENT NOTES
   
Not going to go into too much depth here since I've talked about bursting dynamics rather a lot

  * Three panels show the fast-subsystem phase plane, for various slow subsystem values (smallest, middle, largest)
  * At smallest s, we have only a stable limit cycle, yielding spikes
  * At largest s, we have only a stable equilibrium, yielding quiescence
  * Inbetween, we have both, so the system stays wherever it started off at

  * Bursting arises because the equilibrium/limit cycle periodically disappear, causing the system to jump to the other stable set, and reversing the change of s
    
** Higher dimensional models

What happens if we have two slow variables?

\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -(I_{Ca} + I_{Kdr} + I_{Ks1} + I_{Ks2} + I_l) \\ \nonumber
\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{n_\infty(V) - n}{\tau_n} \\ \nonumber
\frac{\mathrm{d}s_1}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{s_{1\infty}(V) - s_1}{\tau_{s1}} \\ \nonumber
\frac{\mathrm{d}s_2}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{s_{2\infty}(V) - s_2}{\tau_{s2}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Same model as earlier, only we now have two fast variables \(V\) and \(n\), slow variable \(s_1\), and super-slow variable \(s_2\)

** Higher dimensional models
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: plain
   :END:
   * Previously, the slow variable switched spiking on and off
   * Now, the very-slow variable switches the system from bursting to either quiescence or tonic spiking
   * The slow-variable oscillates, and changes direction during the active phase

** More dimensions = more robustness
Planar bursting requires
   * Bistability in the fast subsystem
   * The slow-subsystem nullcline to intersect in the right place
\vfill
This limits the region of parameter space in which bursting can occur
   * Not very good -- biology is noisy and imprecise; if we need very specific values, things probably won't work
   * Adding additional slow dynamics makes things more robuts
   * Interpretation: instead of shifting the state around, the slow variables shift the entire bifurcation diagram back and forth
* 4 Robust non-planar canards
** Canards
   * Canards cause a rapid transition from quiescence to spiking
   * Solution follows fast-subsystem unstable manifold
     * Torus canards follow branches of UPO
   * Canards are non-robust in planar systems
     * Appear in exponentially small region of parameter space
   * Complicated maths shows that these canards can appear robustly in non-planar systems

** Mixed-mode oscillations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: plain
   :END:
   * Canards arise from the existence of a folded node singularity
   * The same structure allows mixed-mode oscillations
     * System oscillates between bigger and smaller oscillations

** COMMENT NOTES

  * Here we see mixed mode oscillations in a HH neuron
  * Alternates between three big spikes, and one little subthreshold oscillation
  * These dynamics appear in the HH equation at lower temperatures
  * That could be interesting biologically
    * Crab chewing is regulated by a bursting neuron
    * The dynamics of this neuron change with temperature, much like this example
    * That means the crabs can't eat when the sea gets too warm
    * Global warming is killing the crabs because their neuronal dynamics have changed

* Why are biologists interested in these dynamics?
** Why are biologists interested?

An example: the spinal cord
\vfill
   * Synaptic coupling is all excitory
     * Expectation: active network, due to positive feedbacks
     * Reality: mostly silent, occasional activity; /why?/
   * Proposed model: synaptic depression; cells that fire together unwire
     * Model shows relaxation oscillations
   * Predictions from multiscale analysis:
     * Electrical perturbations will cause shift between activity and quiescence
     * Length of active, quiescent phase depends on perturbation timings
   * Predictions confirmed experimentally, elucidating spinal cord neurology
     

** COMMENT NOTES
   * Excitory means one neuron spiking will encourage its attached neurons to spike
     * Opposite is inhibitory, where neuron spikes encourage neighbours not to spike
   * Synaptic depression means synapse weakens when neurons either side of it fire together; no relation to excitation and inhibition
   * Relaxation oscillations suggest the dynamics arise from a slow subsystem modulating a fast subsystem; we can artificially alter this behaviour by injecting current, causing a perturbation when we want it, rather than when the slow subsystem wants it
   * This causes the system to jump between the two bistable branches, just like it would when a branch reaches a fold
   * Perturbing early in the cycle means the next phase will be short, as it's already near the bifurcation point
   * These model predictions were all demonstrated in experiments, meaning the model managed to explain why it do be like that

     
** COMMENT Why are biologists interested?
Example 2: insulin production
\vfill
   * Modulated by bursting in pancreatic \(\beta\)-cells
     * Silent at low glucose levels
     * Burst at higher glucose levels
     * More glucose = more time in active phase
   * Model:
     * More glucose = more ATP
     * ATP activates Ca^{2+} pumps
     * Active pumps mean Ca^{2+} accumulation takes longer in active phase, and is removed faster in silent phase
   * More glucose then means longer active phase, shorter silent phase
     * This explains all the obseved dynamics!
   * Modelling predicted that the behaviours arise from interaction between ATP and Ca^{2+} pumps

     
** Practical issues
   
   * How do we identify how many timescales are present?
   * How do we identify what those timescales are?
   * How do we determine whether those timescales are distinct?
   * How do we best partition multiple timescales, when it's not obvious what should be fast, medium, or slow?


** COMMENT NOTES
   
   * How do we identify how many timescales are present?
     * The models so far can be partitioned into slow and fast timescales
     * We might need three timescales, or even more!
     * Without prior knowledge of the system, there's no easy way to determine the number of timescales, or the dimensionality of each subsystem
   * How do we identify what those timescales are?
     * Nondimensionalisation can be used to extract the true timescales, if we have fitted a model
     * This relies on having a fitted model, though!
   * How do we determine whether those timescales are distinct?
     * This may come down to arbitrary decisions
     * If widening the timescale separation doesn't fundamentally change what goes on, they're probably distinct
     * If it changes things slightly, it becomes a judgement call
     * We would typically choose whether the timescales are distinct based on whether that assumption helps elucidate dynamics
     * This is a judgement call, rather than any objective truth
   * How do we best partition multiple timescales, when it's not obvious what should be fast, medium, or slow?
     * Lots of slow variables makes the system hard to analyse; want to class as few variables as possible as being slow
     * Lots of fast variables might not elucidate the dynamics
     * What to do depends on the system in question, so it's again a bit of a judgement call

#+begin_comment
Highlight the practical issues here

   * Identifying how many timescales is hard
   * Identifying what those timescales are is hard
   * Identifying whether those timescales are actually distinct is hard
   
Say we've fitted a model, and there's several different timescales; how do we best partition them?
   * 3 fast 1 slow: doesn't capture results
   * 1 fast 3 slow: hard to work with, can't really eludicate dynamics
   * 1 fast 2 medium 1 slow: easier to work with, captures the results well
What if we had even more variables?
   * Could we have a spectrum of timescales? Or is that a stupid idea?
