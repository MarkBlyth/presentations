  * Neurons are cells; they and their surrounding media contain charged ions
  * Acive transport across the cell membrane means that, at rest, there's a voltage over the membrane
  * At rest, this membrane potential is typically around -70 mV

   * Sodium current activates as membrane potential increases
   * Simple model: current switches on when membrane potential exceeds a threshold
   * It's an inward current, so it brings positive ions into the cell and increases membrane potential
   * This causes positive feedback!

** Potassium description :BMCOL:
   :PROPERTIES:

   * Potassium currents activate as membrane potential increases
   * Potassium forms an outward current - positive ions flow out, returning the membrane potential to its rest value
   * The potassium current turns on and off slower than the sodium current

The interplay of slow potassium and fast sodium currents causes neurons to spike, rather than settling to a steady state

   :END:
  * Sodium currents switch on and off fast
  * Potassium currents switch on and off slowly
  * Slow potassium activation allows the membrane potential to increase fast
  * Once it activates, the potassium current pulls the membrane potential back down
  * Potassium current takes a while to switch off again, so membrane potential gets pulled down to below the turn-on threshold for the two currents

   Currents flow through different ion channels; let's consider each one separately.
   Using current laws,

   The Hodgkin-Huxley model gives each ionic current as a function of membrane potential.
   This is exciting, as we now have a mathematical model of a neuron, to which we can apply a rigorous analysis.

* Why are mathematicians interested in neurons?

  Neurons exhibit a wide range of complex dynamics.
  Mathematical models of these dynamics can be easily tested on physical neurons.
  Interesting features include...
    * Highly nonlinear
    * High-dimensional
    * Multi-timescale dynamics
    * Stochastic behaviour

* Aren't neurons a done science though?

   * Biological literature typically describes neurons in terms of ionic currents
   * This leads to incorrect descriptions (eg. all-or-nothing spikes, thresholds)
   * A mathematical is useful because it let's us explain neural dynamics in a more rigorous, systematic way
   * Many behaviours that seem confusing when explained as ionic currents, have a very natural interpretation in dynamical systems theory
   * Dynamical neuroscience is also something of a new field, though, so there's still a big research gap in experimental bifurcation analysis

All models are wrong, but some are useful


* Numerical continuation
  
  Consider $f(x,\lambda)=0$.
  Numerical continuation seeks to track $x$, as $\lambda$ varies.
  For ODEs of form

  $$\dot{x} = f(x,\lambda)~~,$$
  
  this can be used to find bifurcations.

* Numerical continuation

[[./continuation.png]]

* Control-based continuation
  
CBC allows us to apply continuation methods on black-box numerical or physical systems, no model needed.

    * Use control theory to steer the system onto a (possibly unstable) natural invariant set
    * Track that invariant set as the bifurcation parameter changes

This tracking step can be a classical psuedo-arclength continuation, or something more problem-specific.


* Research problems
  
  * How do we control a highly nonlinear black-box system?
  * How can CBC be extended to study global bifurcations?
  * How do we efficiently discretise spiking signals?
  * Neurons are inherently stochastic; how do we deal with controlling and analysing this?
  * The system has poor observability (eg. can't easily see population ion channel conductance); how do we control a system that we can't observe?
  * We have limited control inputs; how can we use them to steer the dynamics effectively?
