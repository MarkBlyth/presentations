* A brief summary of things
** What am I doing?
   * Neurons are interesting
\vfill
   * Nonlinear dynamics teaches us lots about neurons
\vfill
   * Models are wrong

** How am I doing it?
   * Models are often analysed using numerical continuation
\vfill
   * Numerical continuation needs a model
\vfill
   * Control-based continuation doesn't
     
** What needs to be done?
  * Make it fast
\vfill
  * Make it noise-robust
\vfill
  * Make it happen

** How are those TODOs progressing?
   * Efficiency
     * Current work; lots of problems, lots of progress
\vfill
   * Noise-robustness
     * One paper under review
     * Other ideas under consideration
\vfill
   * Experiments
     * Minireview of literature
     * Some practical experience
   
* More CBC
** Today's agenda
  * A brief summary of things
\vfill
  * *More CBC*
\vfill
  * Results so far
\vfill
  * Current work
\vfill
  
** Control-based continuation
   * CBC works by tracking non-invasive control targets
\vfill
   * It has been tested on `nice' systems, but biological systems aren't nice
\vfill
   * Discretisation is a key part of this
     
* Results so far
** Today's agenda

   * Noise-robustness is important in CBC
\vfill
   * Surrogate modelling is a possible route towards noise-robust experiments

* Current work

** Periodic splines discretisation
   * Discretisation is important
\vfill
   * Efficiency is also important
\vfill
   * Splines could be efficient discretisors

** Current issues

   * Newton solvers don't converge on a solution

   * The solution curve becomes numerically unstable
