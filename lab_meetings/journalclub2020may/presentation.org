** What are bursters?
*** Neurons spike
    
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .9\textwidth
[[./HHraw.pdf]]

Neurons encode information in action potentials


*** Ionic currents

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .9\textwidth
[[./voltage-gated.jpg]]

Action potentials happen from ions flowing into and out of the cell


*** Hodgkin-Huxley
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dV}{dt} &=& \left[I_{inj} - \bar{g}_{Na}m^3h(V-V_{Na}) -\bar{g}_Kn^4(V-V_K) - g_L (V-V_L)\right]/C\nonumber\\
\frac{dn}{dt} &=& \alpha_n(V) (1-n) - \beta_n(V)n\nonumber\\
\frac{dm}{dt} &=& \alpha_m(V) (1-m) - \beta_m(V)m\nonumber\\
\frac{dh}{dt} &=& \alpha_h(V) (1-h) - \beta_h(V)h\nonumber  
\end{eqnarray}

\vfill

We can understand the causes of spike generation with differential equations




*** Nonlinear dynamics
    
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .75\textheight :options trim={0cm 0.5cm 0cm 0cm}, clip
[[./phaseplane.pdf]]

Neuron dynamics rely on limit cycles and equilibria


*** Bifurcations

[[./Ellburst.jpg]]

Equilibria and limit cycles an appear through bifurcations


*** KEY POINT: bursting
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .75\textheight :options trim={0cm 0.75cm 0cm 1.25cm}, clip
[[./clean_HR.pdf]]

Ionic currents can appear to drive the neuron over bifurcations -- this is bursting!

*** Why do cells burst?
   * More reliable for transmitting over synapses
     * Higher signal-to-noise ratio
\vfill
   * Maintain an elevated \(Ca^{2+}\) state
     * Promotes neurotransmitter release
     * Promotes hormone release
\vfill
   * Occur in both the brain and elsewhere
     * pre-Botzinger complex bursters control respiration
     * Pituitory somatotroph bursters /[not neurons]/ use bursts to release hormones


*** Why do we categorise them?
Lots of work is done to categorise bursters, but why?
\vfill
    * Complete classification would describe all the ways a cell could be excitable
\vfill
    * Hints at similarities and differences between cells
      * Small parameter changes can sometimes shift cells into different burster categories
      * `Close' cell categories usually perform similar tasks


*** How do we categorise bursters?
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .75\textheight 
[[./categories.png]]

Under this scheme, there's 16 planar bursters


*** Multiple timescale dynamics

    The previous bursting data can be modelled by

\[\dot{x} = f(x,y)~,\]
\[\dot{y} = \epsilon g(x,y)~,\]
\[|\epsilon| \ll 1~.\]

   * Assume \(\epsilon=0\)
   * Spiking is switched off by bifurcations in \(x\)
     * \(y\) becomes a parameter to cause these bifurcations

[[./burster_diagram.pdf]]

This is a fold-homoclinic burster



*** A better classification
    
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
    * Several bifurcations can happen at the same point
      * A singularity is a point where one or more bifurcations happen
    * If we add some small terms to a singularity /(unfold it)/, we get a bifurcation space
      * We get a model where we can vary some parameters and see some bifurcations
    * A burster will sit in the unfolding of some singularity
      * More unfolding parameters = more complexity
      * More unfolding parameters = higher codimension

*** A better classification
    
Classify in terms of...
\vfill
    * Singularity codimension
      * Measures the complexity of the burster
    * Bifurcations to turn spikes on and off
      * Describes the dynamics of the burster

** Normal forms
*** Normal forms
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
    * Biological models can be complex
    * We can often find simpler models that do the same thing
      * /`Same thing'/ usually means same bifurcation structure
    * A normal form is a simple model that shows prototypical example behaviours
    * A burster normal form is a simple model that can describe the bifurcation structure of any bursting neuron \vfill
      
\vfill

*** Normal form requirements
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .75\textheight 
[[./categories.png]]

A burster normal form must be able to operate as all of these classes

*** Model form
    * The proposed model has \(f(x,y)\) with a complex bifurcation structure...

\[\dot{x} = f(x,y)~,\]

    * ...and a simple \(g(x,y)\) to drive \(f\) over some bifurcations

\[y(t) = A\sin(\omega t)\]

*** Appropriate models
    * Golubitsky found a lot of bursters near the codimension-3 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens singularity:
   
\[f(x,y) = \binom{\quad y\hfill}{-y + \mu x - x^3 + y(\nu + 3x + x^2)}\]

    * Has a rich enough bifurcation structure to show most bursting types

*** How about this?

    * Pituitory cells can also burst
    * Looks similar to previous bursters
    * No stable limit cycle!
      * */How do we categorise this?/*

\vfill
	
This is pseudo-plateau bursting

*** The codimension of pseudo-plateau bursting
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .8\textwidth    
[[./psb.png]]

    * Pseudo-plateau bursting has a similar bifurcation structure to the others
    * It doesn't seem to appear near a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens singularity!
      
*** Singularity choices
    * The original paper goal was to classify the pseudo-plateau burster
    * The burster doesn't seem to appear in codim-3 degenerate Bodganov-Takens unfolding
      * The singularity must not be able to exhibit all known bursting types
      * It can't be a normal form!

\vfill	

Let's free up a parameter:

\[\dot{x} = \binom{\quad y \hfill}{-y + \mu_2 x - x^3 + y(\nu + bx - x^2)}\]

*** A new model
We have

\begin{align}
\dot{x_1} &= y \nonumber \\
\dot{x_2} &= y + \mu_2 x - x^3 + y(\nu + bx - x^2) \nonumber \\
 y &= A \sin(\omega t)  \nonumber
\end{align}	

    * This is the unfolding of a doubly-degenerate Takens-Bogdanov singularity
    * It contains more dynamical richness -- enough to show pseudo-plateau bursting
    * How do we analyse it?

*** Model analysis
We can't plot 4-dimensional bifurcation diagrams, so we need to get creative...

#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
    * The \(b\) axis consists of degenerate Bogdanov-Takens singularities
    * Small \(b\) means we're near the doubly-degenerate BT singularity
      * We have a richer bifurcation structure in the surrounding neighbourhood than for the degenerate BT
    * Let's look for bifurcations at the edge of this small-\(b\) neighbourhood
      * Take \(b\) small
      * Find the surface of a ball around the chosen \(b\)
      * We now have a 2d parameter space!

*** Bifurcation structure

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .9\textwidth
[[./bif.png]]

    * This parameter subspace contains the pseudo-plateau burster
    * The model is a good normal form candidate

*** Section 2 summary
    
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
    * A normal form is a simple model that can display a target bifurcation structure
    * The degenerate Takens-Bogdanov singularity unfolding is /[probably]/ not usable for a normal form
      * The known unfoldings don't contain pseudo-plateau bursters
      * Unknown unfoldings might
    * A doubly-degenerate Bogdanov-Takens singularity /does/ contain pseudo-plateau bursters
      * It is as close as we can currently get to a normal form

    * *Section 3: Transitions between bursting classes*
    * Section 4: Codimension-classification of pseudo-plateau bursting
    * Section 5: Conclusion

** Section 3
*** We can transition between classes
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
 * Plateau and pseudo-plateau bursting cells are similar, functionally and developmentally
 * So are their bifurcation structures: we can switch between the two classes by modifying a single parameter
   * This parameter is analogous to Calcium current activation
 * Similar cells have similar bifurcation structures
 * Biological robustness: we can mess around with parameters and still see similar behaviour
