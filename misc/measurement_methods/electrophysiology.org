#+DATE: 2019-12-16 Mon

* Intro to my project
** Presentation plan
   * *30 second overview of my project*
   * Overview of my mircrofluidics questions
   * Review of potential solutions
** About my project
   * Hodgin and Huxley provided a model of neural dynamics
   * It turns out we can explain all observations from classical neuroscience using dynamical systems theory
   * These explanations typically focus on the bifurcations a neuron can exhibit
   * Bifurcations are analysed from models; I'm wanting to do a bifurcation analysis on a real, living neuron
   * Goal: consider a single neuron, and experimentally find  bifurcations in its dynamics

** Presentation plan
   * 30 second overview of my project
   * *Overview of my mircrofluidics questions*
   * Review of potential solutions
** The big question
   The dynamics of any given neuron typically change when current is injected into that neuron. I'm wanting to observe and control these changes experimentally.
   I need an experimental setup that would allow me to...
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
     * Apply a current into a neuron
     * Observe that neuron's membrane potential
     * Keep the neuron alive as long as possible
     * (If it were possible, also measure each ion channel's average conductance)
   
   QUESTION: what would be an appropriate experimental setup to achieve this?


* Methods
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
% Mention here that I'm going to talk through the different methods I've researched, with the goal being to pick one of them to develop further for the next THETA project

** Bath MEA
   - Idea:
     * Use the current microfluidics device, or a minor modification of it
   - Strengths:
     * Builds on existing work and expertise
   - Weaknesses:
     * Can't isolate the dynamics of an individual neuron
     * Can't give a specific neuron a current input
     * Can't measure membrane potentials

% Why do I think it's inappropriate for my project?
% How much would I need to change in order to use it?

** Glass pipette patch clamp
   - Idea:
     * Use the classical glass pipette method for a whole-cell patch clamp
     * Measure membrane potential and inject current using the electrode
   - Strengths:
     * Allows for studying the dynamics of individual neurons
     * Easy to inject current, and to measure membrane potential
   - Weaknesses:
     * Patch clamping can be difficult
     * Neuron might not survive as long since we can't control nutrients and waste as easily
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
% Explain why patch clamping is more useful for me
% Discuss its limitations (cells die faster, can't control exterior environment easily, hard to do)
#+END_EXPORT

** Off-the-shelf automated patch clamp
   - Idea:
     * Same as before, but use an automated machine to do the patch clamping
   - Strengths:
     * Allows for studying the dynamics of individual neurons
     * Easy to inject current, and to measure membrane potential
     * Much easier than manual patch clamping, no training required
     * Allows constant perfusion for providing nutrients and removing waste 
   - Weaknesses:
     * More expensive than DIY methods (unless we can borrow a machine from somewhere)
     * Might be hard to interface with a custom CBC control system

** TODO DIY microfluidic patch clamper
   - Idea:
     * Combine the MEA and patch clamping methods
     * Build a planar patch clamping microfluidics device in-house
   - Strengths:
     * Allows for studying the dynamics of individual neurons
     * Easy to inject current, and to measure membrane potential
     * Much easier than manual patch clamping, no training required
     * Allows constant perfusion for providing nutrients and removing waste
     * Cheaper and more customisable than buying a machine
   - Weaknesses:
     * Need to design another microfluidics device

** Microfluidics fluorescence chip
   - Idea:
    * Use an existing microfluidics chip, built for GFP imaging
    * Use calcium imaging to observe a neuron's behaviour
   
   - Strengths:
    * Recently developed proteins allow the observations of individual action potentials
    * Might be able to estimate membrane potential from calcium imaging
    * Would allow the use of off-the-shelf chips, with no further developments
     
   - Weaknesses:
    * No obvious way to inject current into the neuron, so any control inputs would have to be pharmacological
    * Probably can't investigate the dynamics of single isolated cells, only networks

 % BRIEF ASIDE
 % Could use calcium imaging to measure neural activity
 % This lacks any way to stimulate the neuron, so if I want to inject current I'd end up turning it into one of the other devices instead
 % (but, could use this and inject drugs to alter ion channel activity)

* Reprise
** The big question (again)
   Which of these methods would best allow me to...
     * Apply a current into a neuron
     * Observe that neuron's membrane potential
     * Keep the neuron alive as long as possible
     * (If it were possible, also measure each ion channel's average conductance)
