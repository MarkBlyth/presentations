\section{Discretisation-free CBC}
\label{sec:orge826b21}
\begin{frame}[label={sec:org5c3acf8}]{Continuation background: points}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continuation works in a predictor corrector scheme
\begin{itemize}
\item Predict the next point on the manifold from the local tangent vector
\item Correct it using a Newton iteration
\item An additional parameter appears -- the arclength parameter -- so require \emph{predictor \(\perp\) corrector} to ensure a well-posed problem
\end{itemize}
\item For equilibrium and equilibrium-bifurcation continuation, we have a finite-dimensional state
\begin{itemize}
\item Tangent vector is of the same dimensionality, and is therefore finite
\item Predictor-corrector scheme is of finite -- usually low -- dimensionality, and is therefore computationally tractable
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For points (equilibria, equilibrium bifurcations) everything works nicely
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgcd31c37}]{Continuation background: orbits}
\begin{itemize}
\item A periodic orbit is some function \(f(t,\lambda),~t\in[0,1]\)
\begin{itemize}
\item \(f\) exists in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
\end{itemize}
\item Continuation of \(f\) in \(\lambda\) requires a discretisation, to produce a finite-dimensional approximation that we can apply standard continuation methods on
\item There's a range of methods for discretisation
\begin{itemize}
\item Orthogonal collocation seeks a set of orthogonal polynomials that satisfy the model at a selection of meshpoints; high accuracy; requires a model
\item Fourier decomposition decomposes a periodic signal into its harmonic components; model-free (important for CBC); sensitive to noise; will be high-dimensional for spiking signals
\item Wavelets, frames, splines, \dots{}, yet to be developed!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgda79251}]{Issues with discretisation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can't use collocation methods without a model
\item Spiking signals would need a lot of Fourier harmonics (quick-changing means lots of high-frequency energy); high dimensional continuation systems are hard
\item Noise would greatly impair Fourier discretisation; can't filter it off without losing the high-frequency components of the signal required for fast spiking
\item Wavelets, frames, splines haven't been developed yet (might also be noise-sensitive?)
\end{itemize}

Can we continue periodic orbits without discretisation?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgb69177e}]{Discretisation-free method: benefits and issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item By avoiding discretisation, we can deal with exteedingly fast-changing signals easily
\item The learning step allows us to average out the noise, in a way that would be difficult using discretisation methods, meaning more numerical stability
\item Uses some machine learning -- a buzzword that seems to bring in citations\ldots{}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org2c4f0a5}]{Basic strategy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn a model of the periodic orbit surface
\item Use that model to project forward to the next periodic orbit
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning and projecting forms the predictor step
\end{itemize}
\item Iterate down on to the surface
\begin{itemize}
\item Iterating down forms the corrector step
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orged14d88}]{A topology interlude}
\begin{itemize}
\item A homotopy \(H\) is a continuous deformation \(H:X \times [0,1] \to Y\) between two topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\)
\item Consider a homotopy \(H\) between functions \(f_1\), \(f_2\), parameterised in some variable \(t\)
\begin{itemize}
\item \(H(f_1, 0) = f_1\)
\item \(H(f_1, 1) = f_2\)
\item Simple example: \(H = f_1 + t(f_2 - f_1)\)
\end{itemize}
\item \href{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/HomotopySmall.gif}{Animation 1}
\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy\#/media/File:Mug\_and\_Torus\_morph.gif}{Animation 2}
\end{itemize}

The overall goal is to learn a continuous homotopic transformation for the predictor/corrector, which can be applied to raw, undiscretised data
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org373f040}]{Mathematical representation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use machine learning to find a homotopy between successive orbits \(f(t, \lambda_{i-1})\), \(f(t, \lambda_i)\)
\item Use this homotopy as a predictor for the next orbit
\item Apply an orthogonal correction step
\begin{itemize}
\item Prediction will be a smooth function estimating \(f(t, \lambda_1)\)
\item Find a corrector family of \(f\) orthogonal to the homotopic step
\item Each \(f\) in this family is a control target, one of which is a periodic orbit of the open-loop system
\item `Slide down' this family of periodic orbits, on to the corrected solution
\item `Sliding down' is done by iteratively updating the control target, much like in Barton et al.
\item By selecting new targets from the corrector family, we're maintaining the orthogonality constraint
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org87db716}]{Learning a homotopy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set \(\lambda = \lambda_0\)
\item Record data for a while
\item Use F\(_{\text{0}}\) estimator to partition data into periods
\item Reconstruct the state space (?)
\item Let \(t \in [0,1]\) measure how far through a period each reconstructed vector is
\item Learn a function \(f_0: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n\), giving the (reconstructed) state at time \(t\)
\item Repeat this for \(\lambda = \lambda_1\), learning function \(f_1\)
\item Learn a homotopy \(H_1: \mathcal{H}\times [0,1] \to \mathcal{H}\), where \(f_i \in \mathcal{H}\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org75b1813}]{The machine learning step}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian processes are the ideal tool for learning \(f_i\), \(H_i\)
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a nonparametric way of modelling arbitrary manifolds
\item Statistically rigorous
\end{itemize}
\item F\(_{\text{0}}\) estimation and state space reconstruction is much like that in my master's thesis
\item Might even be able to get away without the state space reconstruction, but intuitively it seems like everything would work better doing it
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgf36297e}]{Benefits and issues (again)}
\begin{itemize}
\item By avoiding discretisation, we can deal with exteedingly fast-changing signals easily
\item The learning step allows us to average out the noise, in a way that would be difficult using discretisation methods, meaning more numerical stability
\item Uses some machine learning -- a buzzword that seems to bring in citations\ldots{}
\item Prediction step should be fairly straightforward
\item Correction step \emph{might} be straightforward, but has the potential to be more challenging
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
