#+TITLE: A Rinzel-esque bifurcation analysis of some bursting models
#+DATE: [2020-01-20 Mon]

* Background
** Week's goal
    - Focus on bifurcation analysis of Krassy's system
    - Use it as an opportunity to learn about continuation software
    - Once I know enough about any one software, write up about it for the paper
** Week's activities
    - Attempted to read some pure-maths papers about bifurcations of Krassy's cubic Lienard system
      - No success
    - Attempted instead to do a bifurcation analysis on the cubic Lienard system 
      - No success
    - Tried a Rinzel-esque fast-subsystem bifurcation analysis on the HR model (simpler, therefore easier)
      - No success in XPP
      - Some success in MATCONT
    - Went back to Krassy's neuron model again, with newfound MATCONT skills
      - Slightly more success?

* Papers
** Global study of a family of cubic Lienard equations
    - Krassy's model uses a cubic Lienard equation as the fast subsystem
    - This paper derives the global bifurcation diagram of that system
    - It's hard.

** Fast subsystem bifurcations in a slowly varying lienard sysetem exhibiting bursting
    - Krassy's model uses a cubic Lienard equation as the fast subsystem
    - This paper performs various rigorous analyses on that system
    - It's hard.

* HR Bifurcations
** A first attempt at bifurcation diagrams

   - Tried to do a bifurcation analysis of Krassy's system
     - No success
   - Decided instead to try a Rinzel-esque analysis of the HR system
     - Simple system capable of exhibiting bursting
     - Some success

** The Hindmarsh-Rose model
   
A very popular bursting model, given by

\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm d x}{\mathrm d t} &= y - ax^3 +bx^2-z+I~,\\
\frac{\mathrm d y}{\mathrm d t} &= c - dx^2 -y~,\\
\frac{\mathrm d z}{\mathrm d t} &= r\left[s(x-x_R)-z\right]~.
\end{align}

** HR Bifurcations
    - \(b\) influences whether or not the cell bursts, and \(z\) is the slow subsystem variable.
    - Idea: codim-2 bifurcation analysis of the fast subsystem, in terms of \((b,z)\)
      - Goal: find the bifurcations that start and end the hysteresis loop, in the same way as Rinzel classifies bursters
      - Approach it with minimal knowlege of the system, so that I'm learning, rather than copying papers!

** HR Bifurcations

 * Taking \(b=3\) (Wikipedia default value) gives a codim-2 Fold-Hopf burster
 * I haven't dug into the literature to see if this is right (I don't think it is)

    * Hold \(b\), \(\nu\) fixed
    * Sweep \(\mu_1,\mu_2\)
    * Inspired by stuff I didn't understand in Krassy's paper
    * Some similarities to the bifurcation diagrams in the paper...

* Next steps
** Next steps
   * Read more about the cubic Lienard model (some of the papers have a good discussion of bifurcation analysis)
   * Reproduce some of the bifurcation diagrams from the literature
     * Repeat with each of the different continuation softwares I'm testing
   * Once I'm familiar with a software package, add it to the comparison paper
   * To study homoclinic bifurcations, or not to study homoclinic bifurcations?
