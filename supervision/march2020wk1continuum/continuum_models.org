* Challenges
** Main challenge with the MEA
   * Loss of spatial resolution, since we can no longer measure and perturb individual cells
   * Emergent behaviours mean we can't study dynamics of individual neurons; would have to study network dynamics instead
   * Too many unknowns to build a realistic network model...

** Issues with the network model
   * No geometric information 
     * We can make a model of neuron networks, but there's no easy way to relate an agent in the network to the position of a living cell
     * This matters, as we can't predict the spatial dynamics, and therefore the effects of stimulating each electrode, without this information
   * No topological information
     * We don't know who connects to who, in our neuron network
     * This means we can't produce an accurate network model
   * Too many equations for simulations
     * 200,000 neurons is too many to simulate!
   * Too many parameters to accurately determine
     * Even just coupling strength adds between 200,000 and 40,000,000,000 (200,000^2) extra parameters to the model

** Some possible solutions
   * Constrain the network geometry using on-chip microchannels
     * This has been done in the literature
     * Doesn't tell us much about connection strengths
     * Would be a very hard device to make
     * Requires making another new device
   * Use synchronisation-based network models
     * Changing one of 200,000 network connection strengths probably won't change much in the dynamics
     * Can use this lack of sensitivity to make simpler models of neuron synchronisation
     * But, this synchronisation models won't work for any case other than synchronisation (limits the dynamics with specific assumptions)

** A proposed alternative
   * Assume we have an arbitrarily large number of neurons
   * Every neuron connects to every other neuron within its local neighbourhood
   * Treat it as a continuum (neural field, rather than point neurons)
   * Build a PDE model

** Benefits of a continuum model (1)
   * No need to know the network geometry; any given `neuron' is identified by its point in the domain
   * No need to define a network topology; every `neuron' interacts locally with those in its neighbourhood
   * Far fewer parameters are required to characterise the system
     * Don't need to specify a set of parameters for each agent in a network system
   * Becomes tractable to study much more sophisticated dynamics than with the network model (beyond simple synchronisation!)
   * We no longer care about what individual cells are doing, and can therefore get away with the lower spatial resolution of the electrodes
     * Instead, we're measuring the average continuum value across some small region, which is a sufficient measurement; don't need to know the state of every neuron in the network

** Benefits of a continuum model (2)
   * No need to individually perturb single neurons - it suffices to model a current input across some subdomain of the PDE's space
   * Microfluidic electrodes have a very natural mathematical interpretation
     * For an accurate model, neurons can be thought of as `solving' the continuum PDE across their network
     * Numerical methods for solving the model would typically use orthogonal collocation
     * A set of meshpoints are defined, and orthogonal basis functions are chosen such that they solve the PDE at those mesh points
     * The electrodes are therefore a physical analog of these collocation mesh points!
     * Very natural transition between numerical methods, and physical experiments

* Literature precedent
** Literature precedent
   * There's models for neural fields
     * Bressloff, Paul C. "Spatiotemporal dynamics of continuum neural fields." Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 45.3 (2011): 033001.
     * Seems to be based on some rather dubious assumptions (rate-based networks, assume SNIC neurons)
   * There's also cable models for spatially extended neurons
     * Designed to model signal propagation down an axon
     * Could possibly produce a 2d spatially extended system as a continuum model?
     * I don't yet know how important the synaptic dynamics are on continuum dynamics
** The Belousov-Zhabotinksy reaction
Chemical reaction, displaying complex dynamics away from equilibrium.
I claim it behaves in the same way as neurons:
    * Consider reactants as `ions inside a neuron'
    * Consider products as `ions outside a neuron'
    * Consider catalyst concentration as membrane potential
      * Stimulates the transition of reactants into products (and reverse)
      * Equivalently, stimulates the movement of ions into a cell (and out of it)
Dynamics of the BZ reaction are therefore analogous to neural dynamics
    * Stirred system is like an ODE model
      * Can show mixed-mode bursting-like oscillations, and relaxation oscillations
    * Unstirred system is like a spatially extended continuum neuron

** The Belousov-Zhanosinsky reaction

    * This is analogy interesting, as there's lots of research on the various behaviours of the BZ reaction that could be reapplied to predict dynamics of a large neural population.
    * BZ reaction is a reaction-diffusion system, which Alan does lots of research on
    * There's a literature precedent for bifurcation analysis of it

** Controlling the BZ reaction
    * The BZ reaction is a continuum system.
    * Methods have been demonstrated for tracking its dynamics, suggesting that similar approaches may work for neural continuums
    * These follow an OGY/ ETDF style approach.

** Epilepsy, coherent structures, and Turing instabilities
   * Epilepsy is characterised by waves travelling across the surface of the brain [SOURCE?]
   * Travelling waves are a type of `coherent structure' (some structure that appears and persists in the dynamics)
   * More generally, Turing patterns refer to the appearance of coherent structures in reaction-diffusion systems (like BZ reaction!)
   * Since we've added a spatial domain, we now have new ways to bifurcate
     * Lose stability in temporal dimension - traditional bifurcation
     * Lose stability in spatial dimension - Turing instability
   * Turing patterns and instabilities form new bifurcations we could control and test for
     * ...possibly bifurcations that lead to epileptic dynamics?

** Studying continuum models
   * Turing patterns are a very well studied area - lots of literature to draw from
   * There's also lots of literature on PDEs
   * (I conjecture) it would be considerably easier to study bifurcations in the PDEs than in a massive network

* Plan suggestion
** Some issues
   * The continuum model discussed in previous review is rate-based; doesn't generalise to arbitrary neurons, only good for cortical (SNIC) neurons
   * A spatially extended cubic Lienard model would give the dynamics of arbitrary neuron populations, if and only if synaptic dynamics are non-critical
** Possible project plan
   * Produce a neuron normal form model
     * Krasi's cubic Lienard + a slow subsystem
   * Generate a neural continuum model from a spatially extended normal form
   * Analyse bifurcations etc. in the model, to get an idea of what the actual cells will do
   * Develop a CBC approach to track those bifurcations
     
Note that a spatially extended neuron model might not be sufficient; the review cited earlier would be a good place to start on understanding good continuum models.

** Possible project plan

Nice but not necessarily essential:
   * Bigger MEA (more cells = more like a continuum)
   * More electrodes (more collocation meshpoints = more accurate model)
