* Questions for Krasy
    - How do you produce bifurcation diagrams on the surface of a sphere, like those in your paper?

    - How do you find the slow subsystem paths? Trial and error?
      - Given a bifurcation diagram, it seems hard to find paths that actually correspond to bursting. Even finding the right start and end bifurcations and linking them won't necessarily produce a burstable trajectory.
      - Why are we looking at bifurcations on the surface of the sphere? Is it just as a convenient dimensionality reduction? Is there any a priori reason why this surface should have contained the burster path, or was that just a lucky bit of guesswork?

    - Where are you getting the parameter values for the bifurcation regions?
      - Golubitsky uses b=3, mu2 = 1/3. Why?
      - This paper fixes something like b=0.75. Why? Surely then it isn't a codim4 unfolding?
      - The paper claims that for small b (here, b=0.75), any fixed neighbourhood (here the unit ball) around the origin of (mu1,mu2,v) space contains all the additional bifurcations gained from the DD-BT pt. Why? How and why was b=0.75 chosen? How about the unit ball?
      - I don't understand why we're able to fix b at some small value and not limit the types of bifurcation that we see; why does any fixed neighbourhood of 0 in (mu1,mu2,v)-space contain all the relevant bifurcations for sufficiently small b?

    - How do you expect the model to be used?
      - Would I trial and error some parameter vals from a bifurcation diagram diagram, to find the areas of parameter space that give whatever bursting/excitability dynamics I'm interested in studying?
      - How biologically relevant is this model, being a phenomenological one? Will it be able to tell me much about what a living neuron is doing? How much information can we get using it to describe a living cell, if we don't consider the different ionic currents?
      - Is there any nice methods for relating the parameters and parameter values back to what's going on in the live cell? Any real-world interpretation of them?

Notes:
    - In the cubic Lienard model, mu1 is the slow subsystem variable (z), and v is the HR-b-like bursting pattern variable

*** Pure AUTO capabilities
**** Algebraics
    - Compute sol'n families for algebraic eq's of form \(f(u,p)=0\), \(f(\cdot,\cdot) \in \mathbb{R}^n\)
    - Find branch points, and continue them in two or three parameters
    - Find Hopf points, continue them in two parameters, detect criticality, find zero-Hopf, BT, Bautins
    - Find folds, continue in 2 parameters, find cusps, zero-Hopfs, BTs
    - Find branch points, folds, period doubling, Neimark-Sackers, continue these in 2 or 3 params and switch branches at branch points and PD bifs for map fixed points
    - Find extrema of ojective functions along solution families; continue extrema in more params

**** Flows
 Consider an ODE of form \(u'(t) = f\big(u(t), p\big)\), \(f(\cdot, \cdot),~u(\cdot) \in \mathbb{R}^n\).
 AUTO can...
    - Compute stable / unstable periodic sol'n families, and their Floquet multipliers
    - Find folds, branch points, period doublings, Neimark-Sackers, along PO families; branch switching at PO and PD bifs
    - Continue folds, PD bifs, NS bifs in two parameters, and detect 1:{1,2,3,4} resonances
    - Continuation of fixed-period orbits for sufficiently large periods
    - Follow curves of homoclinic orbits, detect and continue codim-2 bifs using HomCont
    - Find extrema of integral objective functions along a periodic solution family; continue extrema in more parameters
    - Compute sol'n curves on the unit interval, subject to nonlinear BCs and integral conditions; discretisation uses an adaptive-mesh orthogonal collocation
    - Determine fold, branch points along sol'n families to the above BVP
**** PDEs
     Also some stuff for reaction-diffusion equations.

*** Things to put in the paper
  Table of comparison:
	  - Bifurcations it can do, curves it can continue, and the types of system they can use
	  - When they fail, crash, etc.
	  - Numerical methods they have available
	  - How much do the parameters need manually fiddling?
	  - Do we need to code or not?

  When writing, aim it at a biology audience.
  Continuation is a sequence of problems - start off at equilibria, then move to tracking codim2 bifurcations, increase the dimension etc.
  Make this nice and clear: explain why we're starting off finding any sorts of bifurcations we can, then continuing those to find others.
  Aim it at someone that doesn't understand continuation (assume they know what bifurcations are, but not continuation methods for finding them).
  A brief section on the maths (eg. why we need to continue from a steady state, and how continuation works) would probably be useful.
*** Investigating the HR model
**** Simplifying assumptions
     - b is a parameter influencing the bursting and spiking behaviour (frequency of spiking, ability or inability to burst)
     - We want to find the start/stop bifurcations when in a spiking regime, so we fix I=2 to force the neuron to spike
     - Freeze the fast subsystem (so, ignore the slow subsystem)
     - We therefore have two bifurcation parameters - slow subsystem state z, and bursting-spiking parameter b
**** Investigation strategy
     - Simulate the neuron for a few different b,z, to see what happens
     - It spikes
     - If the neuron can spike there must be a limit cycle; if there's a planar limit cycle, there must be an equilibrium within it
     - We're interested in when this limit cycle appears or disappears; let's start by investigating how its central equilibrium bifurcates
***** Equilibrium bifurcation
      (1) Find the equilibrium
	 - Simulate the system to get a (x,y) phase portrait, for arbitrary initial conditions, params
	   * Wikipedia says b=3 is a sensible value, so let's use that to start with
	   * The simulations seem to show I=2 as being a nice (but arbitrarily chosen!) value, so let's use that too
	   * (Emphasise that these were chosen just by playing around with simulations)
	 - This shows a stable limit cycle
	 - Choose some point within the limit cycle and integrate backwards
	 - This allows us to find the (unstable!) equilibrium in the middle of the limit cycle
	   - For I=2, b=3, other params at wikipedia default, this gives an equilibrium at x,y=1,-4
      (2) Do a bifurcation analysis in Z of this equilibrium 
	 - We choose to bifurcate in Z since this is the forcing term applied by the slow subsystem that causes bursting
	 - Since we have a 1d slow subsystem, we must have a hysteresis-loop burster; hyseteresis-loops typically have a Z-shaped nullcline, so let's guess that's going to be the case and plot a bifurcation diagram in (z,x) space
	 - We get two LPs and two Hopf's; the first of these Hopfs occurs at z<-10; this is outside the expected range of z for a typical HR firing, so we'll ignore this one and focus on the other three bifs
      (3) Continue the bifurcations in (z,b) space
	 - Get confused and give up?

**** XPP
***** Overview
      - Language: C
      - Interface: GUI only
      - Usage: ODEs, DDEs, SDEs, BVPs, difference equations, functional equations
      - License: GNU GPL V3
***** Notes
      The 'classic' simulation and continuation software.
      Still sees active use in a large range of nonlinear problems.
      Bifurcation (continuation) methods provided by AUTO and HomCont; probably possible to use AUTO by itself, but no one does because it would be very difficult (needs FORTRAN coding), and XPP provides a good interface to do it.
      Takes plain-text input files, with equations written out in text, as opposed to being defined by user-written functions like in eg. matlab.
      From [1], ...
      Over a dozen different solvers, covering stiff systems, integral equations, etc.
      Supports Poincare sections, nullcline plotting, flow fields, etc., so it's good for visualisation, as well as bifurcation analysis.
      Can produce animations in it (somehow?).
      Since it's so popular, there's a wealth of tutorials available for it.
      Somewhat outdated GUI, but it does the job perfectly adequately.
      No command line interface.
      Buggy, sometimes segfaults.

***** Notes
      Huge long documentation file exists, but that's just full of code implementations. 
      Couldn't find any clear, straightforward tutorials for using it.
      Need to code in C and produce a big config file to use the software.
      Even then, I can't tell what the code is actually designed to do...

  \* What do thes mean? Are they actually a bifurcation curve type?
  \** PyDSTool seems to have methods to compute these for fixed points of maps; does that mean they're a maps-only type of curve? Note that it lacks documentation and tests/examples about these methods, so maybe they're not implemented?
  ? indicates that there doesn't appear to be a native way of doing this, however it's possible that there's ways to do it (eg. AUTO97 apparently let's us track LPCs, and PyDSTool let's us define custom curves to follow, so one could possibly construct a customised continuation regime to track limit points of cycles)

* COMMENT Burster bibliography and notes
** LITERATURE SUMMARY
  The literature spends a lot of time trying to classify bursting neurons into different causes for bursts.
  Bursting requires a fast-slow system.
  Rinzel (0) introduces the idea of a frozen fast system.
  Here, we take the limit as \(\epsilon \to 0\), such that the slow system stops changing.
  We treat the slow system state \(y\) as a bifurcation parameter of the fast system.
  The fast system will exhibit a variety of bifurcations under y.
  (Eg. a pair of saddle-node bifurcations, in the Fitzhugh-Naugmo model.)
  The slow variable, when reintroduced, acts as a driving force, which pushes the fast system over these different bifurcations.
   
  Consider the bifurcation set of a bursting system.
  Between each bifurcation point, there exists a stable invariant set.
  At the bifurcation point, an invariant set either disappears, or loses stability.
  The bursting system will trace a path from one invariant set to the next, as the slow subsystem evolves.
  This is all explained nicely in (1).
   
  (1) classifies bursters by the bifurcations at either end of the fast subsystem's hysteresis loop.
  (3) tries to improve Rinzel's (1) classification, by explaining all bursters as slices through an unfolding of a bifurcation.
  (3) considers all of the either-end bifurcations on a 2-parameter bifurcation diagram.
  Any given Rinzel bursting type is given by path / periodic motion / cut across this bifurcation diagram, with the either-end bifurcations being those which the cut passes through at the start and end. 
  This also allows the prediction of more burster types.
  It is noted that the 2d bifurcation diagram is typical of a system near a codim-3 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation.

  (4) improves (3)'s classification method slightly, to classify bursters by the codimension of the unfolding in which they fist appear, as well as by the bifurcations.
  In doing so, it also classifies bursters from the literature as occuring in codim-3 bifurcation unfoldings.
  After (4) was written, psuedo-plateau bursters appeared, which can't be explained in terms of codim-3 unfoldings.
  Krasy's paper (2) extends the unfolding classification further, by adding psuedo-plateau bursters into the classification system.
  This is done by considering the codim-4 unfolding of a doubly degenerate bogdanov takens singularity.
  In studying this unfolding, a slow-subsystem path for psuedo-plaueau bursters is uncovered, as well as suggestions for how the systems bifurcate into regular square-wave (plaueau) bursters.
  The new (codim-4) unfolding also contains all the codim-3 bursters, and hence, (probably?) every type of known burster so far.

  Krasy's paper (2) provides some nice references for the history of explaning bursting.
  The general strategy, as mentioned in Krasy's paper, is to find an unfolding containing any relevant fast-subsystem bifurcations, and a path though the parameter space representing the forcing action of the slow variables.
   
  Krasy's paper uses the cubic Lienard system for the (frozen) fast subsystem, as it is one of the partial unfoldings of a doubly-degenerate Bogdanov Takens bifurcation.
  Since the paper only considers the frozen fast subsystem, it doesn't pay much attention to the slow system.
  A sinusoidal slow subsystem is suggested in the appendices; this forms a slow-wave burster (autonymously oscillating slow subsystem), however no hysteresis-loop slow subsystem is proposed.
  To make the model capable of hysteretic bursting, a different slow subsystem must also be defined.
  (5) therefore builds further on the work of (0)-(4), by using the same sort of classification scheme as gets developed, but by also adding in a model for a hysteretic slow subsystem.
  (The paper also provides a nice review of all the work up to that point, inc. Krasy's paper.)
  (IT ONLY SEEMS TO CONSIDER CODIM-3 [SINGLY] DEGENERATE TB SINGULARITIES; IF SO, THE MODEL CAN'T EXHIBIT KRASSY'S PSUEDO-PLATEAU BURSTING.)

*** Abstract
Pituitary cells of the anterior pituitary gland secrete hormones in
response to patterns of electrical activity. Several types of
pituitary cells produce short bursts of electrical activity which are
more effective than single spikes in evoking hormone release. These
bursts, called pseudo-plateau bursts, are unlike bursts studied
mathematically in neurons (plateau bursting) and the standard
fast-slow analysis used for plateau bursting is of limited use. Using
an alternative fast-slow analysis, with one fast and two slow
variables, we show that pseudo-plateau bursting is a canard-induced
mixed mode oscillation. Using this technique, it is possible to
determine the region of parameter space where bursting occurs as well
as salient properties of the burst such as the number of spikes in the
burst. The information gained from this one-fast/two-slow
decomposition complements the information obtained from a
two-fast/one-slow decomposition.

*** Summary
   Neurons tend to burst because it's a more effective way of triggering hormone / neurotransmitter release than individual spikes.
   This paper looks at different mechanisms to bursting.
   Also contains lots of nice useful references about bursting!

*** Abstract
Several lines of evidence indicate that brief ( < 25 ms) bursts of
high-frequency firing have special importance in brain function.
Recent work shows that many central synapses are surprisingly
unreliable at signaling the arrival of single presynaptic action
potentials to the postsynaptic neuron. However, bursts are reliably
signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these
synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out
single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic
plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single
burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain
structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that
arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action
potentials that arrive singly. These results, and the requirement for
multiple inputs to fire a cell suggest that the best stimulus for
exciting a cell (that is, a neural code) is coincident bursts.

*** Summary
   Synapses are unreliable, and bursting is the best way to get a signal to cross them.
   Acts as a filter and stuff.
   Lots of relevant neural information.

*** Abstract
Various nerve, muscle, and secretory cells exhibit complex electrical
activity which has been observed experimentally by using intracellular
electrodes to monitor the dynamics of the potential across the cell
membrane. Such activity may include single spikes (time scale, msec.)
in response to brief stimuli, repetitive spiking for a maintained
input, and repetitive bursts of spikes (time scale, sec) which may be
endogenous and modulated by chemical (e.g. hormonal) or electrical
stimuli. Pancreatic B­cells respond with periodic bursting in the
presence of glucose (3,13) and this activity is correlated with their
release of insulin (18). Figure 1 illustrates computed solutions of a
theoretical model (4) for such electrical behavior. The mathematical
model (based upon a biophysical model (2)) is an adapted and expanded
version of the classical Hodgkin­Huxley (11) description of nerve
excitability and involves five first­order nonlinear ordinary
differential equations. The time course of membrane potential V(Fig.
1, upper) exhibits spikes of roughly constant size (30­40mV) which
appear to ride on a plateau potential of approximately ­40 mV.
Following each "active phase" of spiking is a "silent phase" where V
slowly increases. The intracellular free calcium concentration Ca
(Fig. 1, lower) slowly increases (on the average) during the active
phase and slowly decreases during the silent phase. The dynamics of Ca
determine the time scale of the bursts. In this paper we present an
analysis and qualitative viewpoint of bursting for the Chay­Keizer
(C­K) theoretical model. We exploit the slow behavior of Ca by first
considering Ca as a parameter and studying its influence on the faster
spike­generating subsystem. Such spike generation dynamics are first
illustrated (Section 2) for a simplified model of excitable membrane
activity with Ca fixed. This two­variable, reduced HH, model yields
single spike and repetitive spike activity such as seen in the active
phase of bursting. In some parameter ranges it exhibits bistability in
which V may rest at a lower stable steady state or oscillate stably
around an upper (unstable) steady state. This latter behavior is also
in the repertoire of the four­variable HH subsystem in the C­K model
and it corresponds to the silent and active phases. Next we append to
the excitation subsystem the slow dynamics of Ca to account for
bursting.

*** Abstract
Burst activity is characterized by slowly alternating phases of near
steady state behavior and trains of rapid spike-like oscillations;
examples of bursting patterns are shown in Fig. 2. These two phases
have been called the silent and active phases respectively [2], In the
case of electrical activity of biological membrane systems the slow
time scale of bursting is on the order of tens of seconds while the
spikes have millisecond time scales. In our study of several specific
models for burst activity we have identified a number of different
mechanisms for burst generation (which are characteristic of classes
of models). We will describe qualitatively some of these mechanisms by
way of the schematic diagrams in Fig. 1.

*** Abstract
A great deal of work has gone into classifying bursting oscillations,
periodic alternations of spiking and quiescence modeled by fast-slow
systems. In such systems, one or more slow variables carry the fast
variables through a sequence of bifurcations that mediate transitions
between oscillations and steady states. The most rigorous approach is
to characterize the bifurcations found in the neighborhood of a
singularity. Fold/homoclinic bursting, along with most other burst
types of interest, has been shown to occur near a singularity of
codimension three by examining bifurcations of a cubic Lienard system.
Modeling and biological considerations suggest that fold/homoclinic
bursting should be found near fold/subHopf bursting, a more recently
identified burst type whose codimension has not been determined yet.
One would expect that fold/subHopf bursting has the same codimension
as fold/homoclinic bursting, because models of these two burst types
have very similar underlying bifurcation diagrams. However, we are
unable to determine a codimension-three singularity that supports
fold/subHopf bursting. Furthermore, we believe that it is not possible
to find a codimension-three singularity that gives rise to all known
types of bursting. Instead, we identify a three-dimensional slice that
contains all known types of bursting in a partial unfolding of a
doubly-degenerate Bodganov–Takens point, which has codimension four.

*** Summary
   Codim-3 unfoldings aren't enough to explain psuedo-plateau bursting.
   To explain it, the paper considers codim-4 unfoldings of a doubly-degenerate Bogdanov Takens bifurcation.
   Not only does this add psuedo-plateau bursters to the classification in (3) and (4), but the resulting unfolding also contains all known burster types, making it a very general bursting model.
**** S1 intro
     - Cells can exhibit bursting dynamics
       - These are useful for encouraging calcium buildup, which in turn helps with hormone and neurotransmitter release
     - Platea bursting is like VdP oscillator, but with the 'high' state as a limit cycle
       - Cell fires spikes from a depolarised state for a while
       - Good for promoting calcium buildup
     - Psuedo-platea bursting is a fairly newly discovered one
       - No LC in the active phase
       - Spikes are actually just the oscillatory transients towards a stable equilibrium (think damped oscillator)
       - This requires a fairly fast slow subsystem, which is a bit weird
       - These burst patterns are yet to be classified; this paper fixes that

**** S2 bursting normal form
     - Chay-Keizer is a biologically plausible (HH-esque) bursting model
     - Hindmarsh-Rose is a phenomenological bursting model
     - Bertram's unfolding classification built on a deg. BT point unfolding
       - The system equations for its unfolding are presented
       - A slow subsystem model is also given, to facilitate bursting
     - A small change (time-reversal) to the d-deg-BT unfolding gives a system that contains all previously categorised bursters, plus more
       - d-deg-BT is our current best guess of a burster normal form

**** S3 finding a fold/subHopf burster path
     - d-deg-BT singularity is at the origin
     - b axis outside of 0 contains entirely deg BT points
       - For some reason, the additional d-d-BT bifurcations occur in any fixed neighbourhood around one of these d-BT points, provided b is sufficiently small. WHY?
       - This means we can reduce the parameter space by fixing b small and considering a fixed neighbourhood of 0 in the (mu1,mu2,v) space; the above statement guarantees that we won't lose any interesting bifurcations by doing this
     - Take the unit sphere as the fixed neighbourhood. This must be a sufficiently sized neighbourhood to contain the interesting additional bifurcations, as we can find a fold/subHopf path actually on the surface of this sphere
     - Yipee we've found a fold/subHopf burster path in codim4, thus giving us an upper bound on its category codim
     - It can also transition to regular (fold/homoclinic) square wave / plateau bursting, just by shifting the Ca threhsold a bit; this is interesting since the two burst types come from cells that are developmentally and functionally very similar
     - Paths through parameter space are also presented for all the currently known burster types, backing up the claim that this is a good model of neuron bursting
     - Some fold/homoclinic bursters can be perturbed to fold/subHopf bursters with a single parameter change; others can't. This means that there's actually different types of fold/homoclinic burster, even though they're part of the same class. It highlights the difference between classifying bursters from unfoldings, which considers the surrounding bifurcation structure and how that influences cell properties and neighbour cells, and the Rinzel / Izhikevich approach of classifying by the bifurcations that start and stop bursting.
**** S4 fold/subHopf codimension
We now know fold/subHopf bursting can appear in codim4 unfoldings, but can it appear in codim3?
Tl;dr not all codim3 d-BT unfoldings are known, but fold/subHopf doesn't appear in any of the known ones.
     - Fold/subHopf has a region of bistability, with a subHopf on the top branch, ending at a homoclinic
     - Bistable region means the causing singularity must lie on a cusp
     - Hopf and  homoclinic mean we must be at a BT
     - BT + cusp = d-BT point

But... fold/subHopf can't appear near a d-BT. 

Some long argument that concludes it's probably a codim4 burster.

**** An interesting note from the conclusion
Maths has basically only considered planar fast-subsystem bursters.
Cells need to operate in uncertain conditions, and have lots of robustness, so they have a non-minimal set of ion channels, which means they don't actually have planar fast subsystems.
Furthermore, when we couple cells, their fast subsystems grow in dimensionality.
The surface has barely been scratched on these more complex burster types.
Mixed-mode oscillations ideas would be a good place to look into this from.

*** Abstract
We describe a classification scheme for bursting oscillations which
encompasses many of those found in the literature on bursting in
excitable media. This is an extension of the scheme of Rinzel (in
Mathematical Topics in Population Biology, Springer, Berlin, 1987),
put in the context of a sequence of horizontal cuts through a
two-parameter bifurcation diagram. We use this to describe the
phenomenological character of different types of bursting, addressing
the issue of how well the bursting can be characterized giventhe
limited amount of information often available in experimental
settings.

*** Abstract
Many processes in nature are characterized by periodic bursts of activity separated by intervals of quiescence. In this chapter we describe a method for classifying the types of bursting that occur in models in which variables evolve on two different timescales, ie, fast-slow systems. The classification is based on the observation that the bifurcations of the fast system that lead to bursting can be collapsed to a single local bifurcation, generally of higher codimension. The bursting is recovered as the slow variables periodically trace a closed ...

*** Summary 


   (3) explains bursting as cuts through a codim-2 bifurcation diagram. 
   This paper takes things a step further, by classifying bursters according to their complexity, in terms of the codimension of the bifurcation in whose unfolding the burster first appears.
   It also extends (3)'s classification to include some codim-3 bursters, which covered all known bursters at the time it was written.
   (2) takes this even further by studying codim-4 to explain more recently found psuedo-plateau bursters.

*** Abstract
Bursting is a phenomenon found in a variety of physical and biological
systems. For example, in neuroscience, bursting is believed to play a
key role in the way information is transferred in the nervous system.
In this work, we propose a model that, appropriately tuned, can
display several types of bursting behaviors. The model contains two
subsystems acting at different time scales. For the fast subsystem we
use the planar unfolding of a high codimension singularity. In its
bifurcation diagram, we locate paths that underlie the right sequence
of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow subsystem steers the
fast one back and forth along these paths leading to bursting
behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of
bursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystem.
Transitions between classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow
modulation of the model’s parameters. A detailed exploration of the
parameter space allows predicting possible transitions. This provides
a single framework to understand the coexistence of diverse bursting
patterns in physical and biological systems or in models.

*** Summary
   Extends Krasy's work (sort of?) by providing a slow subsystem to complete a model of hysteresis loop codim-3 bursters.
   Model will be useful for CBC.

*** Abstract
We derive the global bifurcation diagram of a three-parameter family
of cubic Liénard systems. This family seems to have a universal
character in that its bifurcation diagram (or parts of it) appears in
many models from applications for which a combination of hysteretic
and self-oscillatory behaviour is essential. The family emerges as a
partial unfolding of a doubly degenerate Bogdanov-Takens point, that
is, of the codimension-four singularity with nilpotent linear part and
no quadratic terms in the normal form. We give a new presentation of a
local four-parameter bifurcation diagram which is a candidate for the
universal unfolding of this singularity.

*** Summary
   Krasy's model uses a cubic Lienard equation as the fast subsystem. 
   This paper derives the global bifurcation diagram of the system.
   It's hard.
   The paper contains some nice analytical descriptions of where in parameter space some bifurcations occur, but it also contains some particularly confusing theorems and proofs and stuff.

*** Abstract
A perturbed Liénard differential system is examined using local
stability and Hopf bifurcation analyses, asymptotic techniques, and
Melnikov's method. The results of these analyses are applied to a
simple cubic model that exhibits a variety of different oscillatory
behaviors for different parameter values. For a bounded region in
(fast) parameter space, the model exhibits square-wave bursting
patterns analogous to the bursting electrical activity observed in
pancreatic ,$\beta $-cells. Under certain hypotheses, solutions of the
cubic model are known to have square-wave patterns. By using the
theory developed for the more general Liénard system, each hypothesis
is shown to correspond to a curve in parameter space. Together, the
curves bound a region in which the model exhibits square-wave bursting
patterns. Since the model is simple, the curves that bound this region
can all be determined analytically.

*** Summary 
   Contains some nice references about bursting sytems, and has a nice model derivation.
   Also contains some rather impenetrable mathematical analysis.
