   * Implemented some code for vdP CBC
   * Getting splines to work will require either huge numbers of BSplines, or adaptive knots
   * Tested it out in the Fourier case instead
   * Fourier had some numerical issues
     * Ended up with a singular Jacobian for some FDSS
     * Can't Newton-update with a singular Jacobian
     * SciPy solvers also didn't work
     * Didn't put too much effort into finding out why
       * Would probably see the same errors in the splines case
       * Splines has nicer numbers (consistently O(1)) and fewer of them (lower-dimensional discretisation)
       * That means it would be easier to debug the errors with splines than with Fourier
       * Decided to skip the numerics checking and just use splines instead
   * Adaptive knots BSplines will hopefully be a lot easier to use, and to calculate Jacobians from
     * Larger coefficients
     * More uniform order of magnitude across the coefficients
     * Fewer coefficients
   * Decided to jump into adaptive knots instead
   
Implementing adaptive splines first
   * Discuss how I adaptive-knots
   * Explain that we optimize at the start, then re-optimize throughout, as we don't know what the signals look like before we've reached them, so we can't optimize over the entire set of possible signals; must make do with local information instead
   * Need to re-discretise the signal at each step, otherwise we're comparing apples and oranges

Also read an interesting paper on islets
   * Put a quick summary in
   * Discuss implications for CBC
   * Recommend starting experiments really simply with non-bursters
   
Spent some time writing notes on discretisors
   * In progress, nothing to show yet

* Background
** Week's activities
   * Implemented van der Pol (vdP) CBC with Fourier
     * Doesn't work
\vfill
   * Implemented adaptive-knots splines
     * Requried to make BSpline CBC work with vdP
\vfill
   * Implemented vdP CBC with BSplines
     * Doesn't work
\vfill
   * Read about practical bursters
\vfill
   * Wrote some notes on discretisors
     
     
** Reading
Read about why single cells don't burst but populations do
   * Bursting requires quite specific parameter values
   * Real cells have enough variation in these parameters that it's rare to find one that can burst
   * Coupled cells can take on the dynamics of their averaged parameter values
     * Individual cells rarely lie within the bursting parameter range
     * Collections of cells average out their parameter values and allow bursting
\vfill
Issue: bursts in networks are a bit messy
   * Individual cells in the network no longer show nice neat bursts
   * Can't define any nice neat control target
   * Limits the scope to which CBC can be applied
     
** Noisy bursts

\vfill
  * These results are from simulations
  * Question for Krasi is how biologically realistic this is
    * Can we ever get `nice' bursts in real cells?


* Extended CBC
** Autonymous CBC
   * Continuation vector contains parameter, period, discretisation
     * Initialisation parameters chosen by user
     * Initialisation period determined by zero-crossings
     * Initialisation discretisation found by discretising uncontrolled system output at initial parameters
\vfill
   * Continuation equations enforce...
     * Input discretisation = output discretisation
     * Pseudo-arclength condition
     * Integral phase condition, with previous accepted solution as a reference \(v(t)\)
\vfill
\[\Psi[x^*] = \int_0^1 \left\langle x^*\left(\frac{t}{T_{x^*}}\right),  \dot{v}\left(\frac{t}{T_v}\right) \right\rangle \mathrm{d}t\]

** Fourier vdP
Not much benefit to nonadaptive-knots vdP BSpline CBC
    * vdP signal is very nonlinear; nonadaptive would need lots of coefficients
    * If we're using lots, may as well use the simpler Fourier method
\vfill
Tested out vdP-Fourier
    * Didn't work, Jacobian somehow ended up singular
    * SciPy solvers didn't work either
\vfill
Didn't put much effort into testing why this happens
    * Splines would be easier to test
      * Nicer numbers (consistently \(\mathcal{O}(1)\))
      * Fewer of them (lower-dimensional discretisation)
    * Decided to skip the numerics checking and jump straight to splines

** Part 1: initialising adaptive knots
BSplines need adaptive knots to be useful on vdP; this works as follows
\vfill
Choose good knots at initialisation
   * Let \(\xi\) be a knot vector, \(x_0\) be the initialiser signal, \(\hat{x}(\xi)\) its least-squares spline approximation
   * Find \(\mathrm{argmin }\xi \quad \|x_0 - \hat{x}(\xi)\|_2^2\), over signal samples
     * Initialise knots as uniformly distributed random variables
     * Numerically optimize
     * Repeat lots of times to avoid local minima
     * Choose the best result

** Part 2: Adapting the adaptive knots
Knots are updated after each prediction/correction step
\vfill
   * Initial knots will already be a good guess of optimal knots
     * They were optimal for the previous signal
     * We assume optimal knot set changes smoothly with signal
   * Run a single optimization step
     * Fit knots to the newly accepted output signal
   * Update current knots to newly optimized result
     
** Part 3: Using adaptive knots
Must re-discretise at each prediction/corrector step
\vfill
   * Discretisation must be consistent between all vectors in any given prediction/corretion step
   * Take accepted solutions from previous two results and project on to the current knot set
   * Use the rediscretised solutions for secant prediction
\vfill
Goodness-of-fit of each knot optimization result gives us a good check that the discretisation is still valid
   * If goodness-of-fit becomes bad, we might need more knots in the discretisation
   * I hold discretisation size fixed, but it could easily be varied

** Adaptive-BSpline autonymous CBC
   It doesn't work very well
   
[[./fail.pdf]]
   

** vdP system is comparatively simple
No folds to traverse
    * No need for the pseudo-arclength condition
    * Can remove it to simplify the continuation system
    * Increment the parameter, solve for the BSpline coefficients
\vfill
No unstable periodic orbits
     * Can do away with secant prediction
       * Simulate the system at a target parameter value
       * Discretise its output
       * Use that as the prediction
       * We can do this easily if we remove the PAC and hold the parameter fixed
     * The system output is a noninvasive control target
       * If its discretisation is not a solution to the continuation equations, /no solution must exist/
	 
** Tests to try
No pseudo-arclength condition
   * Makes things simpler
   * Should make it easier for the correction steps to converge, as we're simply fitting the shape of the signal
   * If we can't solve this, it's probably because a solution doesn't exist
\vfill
Starting from a known solution
     * Use the discretised, known noninvasive control as a prediction
     * See what the correction steps do, if anything
     * If the prediction doesn't immediately solve the (PAC-free) system, a solution definitely doesn't exist
       
** If a solution doesn't exist...
Currently solving...
   * Input coefficients = output coefficients
   * Pseudo arclength condition = 0
   * Phase condition = 0
\vfill
Alternative: 
   * Minimise \(\|\)input coefficients - output coefficients\(\|\)
   * Or minimise \(\|\)input function - output function\(\|\), such that...
   * Pseudo arclength condition = 0
   * Phase condition = 0
\vfill
Use Lagrange multipliers to make an unconstrained optimisation problem, and perhaps BayesOpt for an efficient solution method


** COMMENT Possible issues and improvements
Code is only just finished
   * Haven't had time to test stepsizes, Jacobian methods, solvers, etc.
   * Might be as simple as a different stepsize

** COMMENT Phase constraints
Maybe the continuation equations aren't very good?
   * No particular reason why Galerkin projections should be robust at estimating period
     * Counter-argument: it's worked fine for other people!
   * Phase constraint makes the coefficients similar to their previous values; doesn't encode anything particularly interesting or meaningful
     * Must be specified to get a unique solution, however doesn't encode anything interesting; doesn't help us find a solution in a numerically robust way
\vfill
   * Collocation is a good way to find oscillation periods
     * Keeps extending a solution boundary around the limit cycle, until it finds the period that makes the two boundaries meet
     * Phase constraint encodes where to put one of the boundaries
\vfill
Collocation might be a generally more robust way of doing things

* Next steps
** Next steps
   * Play some more with the code and see if anything interesting can be made to happen
   * If it can't, try the proposed tests to see if a solution actually exists
   * If it doesn't try...
     * Collocation
     * Invasiveness minimisation
   * Also, keep reading and writing
