#+AUTHOR: Mark Blyth
#+TITLE: GPR on non-trivial data
#+DATE:

* Background
** Week's work
   * Redraft the continuations paper
     * Done, but I want another full read
   * Test GPR on various different cases
     * Different models
     * Stochastic and deterministic simulations
     * Many and few datapoints
   * Other stuff: tidied up my assortments of codes
       
* Models
** Stochasticity

   * Looked into stochastic neuron models
     * They're hard -- requires stochastic calculus, stochastic integrators, etc., which I don't know anything about
   * Produce all sorts of non-trivial dynamics
     * Stochastic and coherence resonance
     * P-bifurcations

\vfill

   * Very interesting area, but also another can of worms
   * Suggestion: test GPR on deterministic models + noise, then move on to stochastics
     * Start reading a stochastics textbook?

** GPR testing
   * Set up a script to generate lots of neuron simulations /[next slides]/
   * Working on adding in the simpler kernels I've been playing with
   * Goal: test...
     * four models (FH, HR, HR fast, HH)...
     * with three kernels (SE, modulo, cosine)...
     * with and without noise
   * 24 different cases
     * The code structure makes it easy to switch between cases
     * Taking a long time to fit each kernel (log-likelihood had an error!)

Can also put presentations on GitHub?

** Next steps
   * /[More]/ teaching
   * Full re-read of paper

then...

\vfill
   * More GPR testing
     * Add more kernels into the testing setup
     * Test everything!
