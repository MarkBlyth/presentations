    * Changed timescale separation
    * `Widens out' Canard explosion
    * Makes signal less nonlinear, more readily described with Fourier

DONE:
  * IO-map method for (harmonically forced) Duffing, Fourier discretisation
    * No phase constraint; signal period taken from forcing parameter
  * IO-map method for modified Fitzhugh-Nagumo model, Fourier discretisation
    * Phase constraint; signal period treated as continuation parameter

\vfill
TODOs:
  * CBC with splines discretisation
  * CBC using the `other' (non-IO-map) method
  * CBC on the equilibrium

* Paper
** Conference paper

Currently drafted:
    * Intro
    * Maths behind CBC, plus motivation of discretisation
    * Novel discretisation methods
\vfill
TODOs:
    * Surrogate models as adaptive filters for cleaner Fourier discretisation
    * Usage cases of surrogates, novel discretisors
      * Might merge with conclusion or intro
    * Conclusion
    * Figures
    * Proof-reading / editing / re-drafting
* Next steps
** Next steps
   1. Write paper
      * Goal: finish text by Friday
   2. Generate figs for paper
      * Splines vs. Fourier: goodness-of-fit vs. dimensionality of discretisation
      * Splines vs. Fourier: noise-robustness
      * Plus any figs for the surrogates section
   3. Proof read, re-draft, edit paper
   4. Implement a splines-based CBC
      * Not essential, but paper would benefit from saying we've done it
      * Best to get a completed paper first, then start on this
