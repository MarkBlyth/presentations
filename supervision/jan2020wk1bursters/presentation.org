* COMMENT Notes

Overall goal: learn about Krassy's neuron model, so that I can use it as an example system for the bifurcation paper.

Krassy's model is a burster; I haven't studied bursters yet, so I looked at those (and the burster papers Krassy's paper builds on) to help understand what's going on in it.

Bursters are a fast-slow system.
Rinzel's freezing method:
    Slow subsystem changes slowly.
    Consider the limit as the sytem gets arbitrarily slow.
    Slow subsystem state vector stops changing, therefore becomes fixed.
    A fixed input to the fast subsystem is effectively a parameter vector.
    Idea: treat slow subsystem state as parameters of the fast subsystem.
    Analyse the bifurcations present in the fast subsystem, using slow subsystem as bifurcation parameters.
    Then, reintroduce the slow subsystem, so see how it drives the fast subsystem through its bifurcation landscape.
Rinzel classified the known bursters at the time, according to the bifurcations at either end of the slow subsystem loop.

Later work realised that the fast subsystem bifurcations are points in the unfolding of a higher-codimension singularity.
It classifies burster's complexity as the codimension of the singularity in whose unfolding the burster first appears.
The burster is then represented as a path through the unfolding of that singularity, with the slow subsystem defining this path.
Previous work explained the known bursters at the time through the unfolding of a codim-2, then codim-3 singularity.
Krassy's work adds a newly found burster (psuedo-plateau burster) into the mix, by showing it occurs in the codimension four unfolding of a doubly degenerate Bogdanov Takens singularity.
Krassy et al. then study the possible bifurcations of a cubic Lienard system, to demonstrate that it is able to contain all known bursters (I think?).

Her paper uses a sinusoidal slow variable to drive the fast system.
This is a slow-wave burster (slow subsystem acts in waves), and would require a 2d+ slow subsystem.
Van der Pol relaxation oscillators are hysteretic - the slow subsystem is 1d, and the hysteresis loop causes the system to transition across bifurcations.
The 2017 paper therefore introduces a model that extends Krassy's, as it can also exhibit hysteretic bursting.
The model is able to explain virtually all known bursting behaviour.
As far as I can tell, normal (non-bursting) behaviour must also be explained, as presumably this would be obtained by actually setting the slow subsystem to zero.
The paper also explains how bursters can transition between classes, by the slow subsystem path changing to other regions of the parameter space. 
This would be a wholly new type of burster bifurcation - a change in the bifurcations the burster exhibits (a bifurcation of bifurcations?).
This ultra-slow transition of classes could be an interesting area to study, but would be veeeery hard.

Other work: background reading of a more pure-maths bifurcation theory, to try (unsuccessfully) to get an intuitive understanding of singularities, transversality, bifurations, unfoldings, etc.


* Background
** Week's goal
   * Get familiar with Krassy's neuron model
   * Do some bifurcation analysis with it
   * Use the neuron and its bifurcation analysis to write a comparison paper for continuation software

** Krassy's neuron model
   * Paper goal: classify the psuedo-plateau burster using the codimension burster classification
   * Issue: I know nothing about burster dynamics!

** Week's activities
   * Learned about burster dynamics
   * Learned about the codimension classification system for bursters
   * Used that to (sort of?) understand Krassy's paper
   * Found a paper that builds on it, and proposes a potentially very useful neuron model


* Burster dynamics
** What is bursting?

** Rinzel's burster analysis
   Consider the system

\[ \dot{x} = f(x,y) ~FAST,\]
\[ \dot{y} = \varepsilon g(x,y)~SLOW,\]

where 

\[ |\varepsilon| \ll 1~,\] and \[f,g \in \mathcal{O}(1)~.\]

** Rinzel's burster analysis
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
    * Consider the singular limit \(\varepsilon \to 0\)
    * The change in \(y\) drops to zero, so \(y\) becomes a constant
    * As \(y\) is now a constant vector, it can be considered as a parameter vector to the fast subsystem
    * Rinzel's approach: consider the bifurcations of the fast subsystem at the singular limit; take the slow subsystem state \(y\) to be a bifurcation parameter, and perform a bifurcation analysis of the fast subsystem with respect to \(y\)
    * Bursting dynamics are then obtained when the slow subsystem dynamics drives the fast subsystem back and forth over one or more bifurcations.

* Burster classification
** Krassy et al.'s paper

   * Lots of work has been done to classify bursters
   * Krassy's paper seeks to classify the (recently found) psuedo-plateau burster 
   * This is achieved by studying the unfolding of a codimension-4 singularity
   * The singularity unfolding could (presumably?) also double up as a generic neuron model

The paper builds on the work of Rinzel, Bertram, and Golubitsky (and other less relevant work), briefly recounted as follows.

** Classifying bursters - background
   * Rinzel's work allows for the classification of bursters, according to the bifurcations at either end of the hysteresis loop

** Classifying bursters - background
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
   * Rinzel's work allows for the classification of bursters, according to the bifurcations at either end of the hysteresis loop
   * Izhikevich notes that there are four bifurcations that can lead to the onset or termination of bursting, meaning 16 different bursters can exist for a planar fast subsystem
   * Later work decided there's a better way of classifying bursters, in terms of unfoldings of high-codimension singularities

** Classifying bursters - Bertram

   * Observation: hysteresis-loop bursters require two bifurcations - one to start spiking, and one to stop it
   * Instead of considering them as isolated bifurcations, consider them as part of the unfolding of a higher-codimension singularity

    * Bursting behaviours are defined by their paths across fast-subsystem bifurcations
    * This is represented as horizontal paths on (here) a two-parameter bifurcation diagram
    * These cuts represent the paths in parameter space that the slow subsystem drives the fast system through
    * Not only does this allow us to classify bursters, but it also allows the prediction of new ones

** Classifying bursters - Golubitsky

   * Golubitsky et al. produced a more rigorous version of Bertram's classification
   * The classification is extended to the codimension-3 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens singularity
   * Bursting behaviour later appeared that couldn't be explained as an unfolding of a codim-2 singularity, but could be explained in codim-3
   * The complexity of a burster is defined as the codimension of the singularity in whose unfolding the bursting behaviour first appears; the codim-3 burster would therefore be considered more complex than the codim-2 ones

** Classifying bursters - Krassy et al.

   * Psuedo-plateau bursting is a type of bursting where there's no sustained oscillations in the active phase
   * As far as we know, it can't be explained in terms of codim-3 unfoldings
   * Krassy's paper expands the existing burster classification to include psuedo-plateau bursters
   * A codim-4 doubly-degenerate Bogdanov Takens singularity is shown to include the burster in its unfoldings
   * It is thought to be codim-4, as no codim-3 unfolding is yet known to contain the bursting dynamics


* Neuron models
** Towards a generic neuron model

   * The codim-4 unfolding will contain all known bursters (I think?)
   * By ignoring the slow subsystem, we can instead let injected current drive the system across a bifurcation (not necessarily in a biologically plausible way)
   * The model will therefore be able to demonstrate all the bifurcations a non-bursting neuron can undergo
   * This makes it a potential candidate for a generic model

** Towards a generic neuron model
   
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
   * Bursters in Krassy's paper are driven by a sinusoidal forcing term
   * This means the slow subsystem must be self-oscillating (called a slow-wave burster)
   * We can also have resonant slow subsystems, which don't oscillate on their own (hysteresis-loop bursters, acting in similar ways to Fitzhugh-Nagumo)
   * To model all neuron types (inc. hysteresis- and slow-wave bursters), we need a different slow subsystem model
   * I've found a paper (ref below) that builds extensively on Krassy's paper to develop such a model
   * It is designed to model just about every single neuron that's likely to exist, making it another good generic neuron model


* Next steps
** Next steps
   * I don't really understand the bifurcations of Krassy's neuron model, so work on achieving that
   * Read paper about the generic neuron model, and its bifurcations
   * Decide which bifurcations to test myself
   * Use XPP etc. to do a bifurcation analysis on the model
   * Use those analyses to produce a software comparison paper
   * Also, look at networks of neurons and their models, dynamics, bifurcations, etc.
   * Then, start learning about control strategies
