#+TITLE: Work plan July -- September
#+DATE:

* Plan
Short presentation this time!
  * Ideas a september conference paper should cover
  * Work that needs to be done for that to happen

* Conference paper goal
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
  * Highlight issues with Fourier discretisation
    * Noise, dimensionality
  * Show how surrogate modelling fixes noise
  * Show how surrogate model can be discretised with standard techniques, for lower dimensionality than Fourier
      * Ideally, surrogate model will discretise data, but there's still value in having separate surrogate and discretisation steps
  * Other CBC arguments
    * More accurate signal reconstruction from discretisation?
    * Faster control-target evaluation?
    * Discretisation-free prediction step?

* Missing things
#+ATTR_LATEX: :overlay [<+->]
    * Discretise the cleaned surrogate-modelled signal
      * Conduct a mini-survey of available discretisation methods
      * Use a discretisation that encodes periodicity, ideally a hybrid surrogate and discretisation
    * Rigorous validation of models
      * Start writing paper at this point!
    * /Comparison of BARS / GPR to other popular time series models/
    * /Run simple transformations (logs, sigmoids) for GPR on non-stationary signals/
    * _Warping GPRs for automatically transforming nonstationary signals_
    * _Testing discretisation results on in-silico CBC_
