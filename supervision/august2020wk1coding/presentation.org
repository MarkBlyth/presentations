* Background
** Week's work
   * Redraft continuation review
   * Run in-silico CBC with Fourier, splines
     * Doesn't work
     * Simplest case (Fourier, Duffing) doesn't work either
* Pictures of code not working
** No controller, no orthogonality constraint
Code fits a discretisation to the uncontrolled system output; useful to test Newton convergence

** No controller, orthogonality constraint
Code fits a discretisation to the uncontrolled system output, with psuedo-arclength regularisation; fails in the expected way

[[./controlfree_continuation.pdf]]

** Full control-based continuation
   
[[./failed_duffing.pdf]]

PD control. \(k_p=5,~k_d=1\)

** Full control-based continuation
   
[[./p-only-failed_CBC.pdf]]

P control. \(k_p=5,~k_d=0\)

** System inputs and outputs match properly

[[./trial.pdf]]

** Control setup
   \[\begin{cases}
      \dot{x} &= y \\
      \dot{y} &= f(x,y) + u(t)
     \end{cases}\]
\vfill
   \[u(t) = k_p(u^*(t) - x) + k_d(u'^{\ast}(t) - y)\]

** Tests
  * Reduced it to simplest possible code / maths
  * Checked continuation system against the literature
  * Checked controlled systems work properly
  * Checked discretisations match signals properly
  * Tried different RHS's (Duffing, Fitzhugh Nagumo, `weak' Fitzhugh Nagumo)
  * Played with hyperparameters (control gains, step size)

** Next steps
   * Start writing conference paper
     * Figure out best coding approach based on that
   * House moving
