* COMMENT Abstract
 
Neurons exhibit a wide range of complex dynamics, which provide a range of interesting problems for mathematicians to play with. These include multiple timescale dynamics, mixed-mode oscillations, and stochastic and coherence resonance. Dynamical neuroscience is an emerging field that seeks to explain the results of classical neuroscience in terms of these mathematical phenomena. Early successes include the explanation of all neural encodings in terms of just four bifurcations, and the use of unfolding theory to classify and predict the existence of new bursting neurons. One must remember, however, that these models are merely a mathematical abstraction. Neurons do not care for the intricate descriptions of mathematicians, and any conclusions from mathematics are only as good as the models from which they are derived. Consequently, one must take the results from dynamical neuroscience with a healthy degree of scepticism. One can build confidence in these results through a combination of better models, and experimental validation. However, an alternative approach is to avoid the reality gap entirely, by performing the usual mathematical analyses on real living neurons, instead of mathematical models. Control-based continuation (CBC) provides a means for running bifurcation analysis experiments on black-box systems, such as living cells. Here I shall discuss progress towards a model-free bifurcation analysis of neurons using CBC. A brief introduction is provided into the concepts underpinning dynamical neuroscience. Bifurcations are discussed as being the source of neural encodings, and a discussion is presented on possible methods to analyse these bifurcations. Subject to time constraints, bonus material may be presented, looking into mixed-mode oscillations in the unfolding of a codim-4 singularity, and the counterintuitive effects of introducing noise to systems near a bifurcation point.

How much did we really learn about bursting cells, by looking at a phenomenological model with arbitrary parameters?


* Control-based continuation
** A novel alternative

  * We can run continuation experiments on models, but those models aren't always meaningful
  * Can we instead run a continuation procedure on a living cell?

    * Can't choose arbitrary simulations, so use a control system to make the system behave how we want it to
    * No control action \(\implies\) system acts under its natural dynamics
    * Goal: find a control target that can be stabilised with no control action

** Control-based continuation
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{block}{Goal}
    Find a control target \(x_*(t)\) that can be stabilised with no control action
\end{block}
#+END_EXPORT

    * Consider \(\dot{x} = f(x,t)\)
    * A controller is a function \(u(x,t)\), such that the controlled system

\begin{equation}
\dot{x}_c = f(x_c,t) + u(x_c,t)
\end{equation}

satisfies \(\lim_{t\to T}\left[x(t)\right] = x_*(t)\)

** Control-based continuation

    - Say \(u(x,t) = 0\), when the control target is \(x_*(t)\)
    - Controlled system is then given by
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= f(x,t) + u(x,t) \nonumber \\
&= f(x,t) + 0 \nonumber \\
&= f(x,t)\nonumber
\end{align}

    - This is our original, open-loop system!

    For control target \(x_*(t)\), the control scheme is said to be noninvasive, and the system acts under its natural dynamics

** Basic example

    - Consider \(\dot{x} = -x\)
    - We add a controller to stabilise an arbitrary point \(x_*\)
    - If we can find a point that requires no effort to stabilise, we've found an equilibrium
    - We need to push the system to hold it at any \(x\neq0\)
      - \(x=0\) is the only point requiring no pushing
      - \(x=0\) therefore drives \(u(x,t)\) to zero, and is an equilibrium under open-loop dynamics

** Another look at numerical continuation

Numerical continuation is a method for computing implicitly defined manifolds
   - Consider \(f(x,\lambda)=0\)
   - Implicit function theorem \(\implies\) changing \lambda causes a change in \(x\)
   - Continuation lets us find the manifold \(\lambda(x)\) implicitly defined by \(f(x,\lambda)=0\)
     
Normally, \(f\) is the RHS of an ODE.
But what if it wasn't?

** Back to CBC
   * As it happens, \(u(x,t)=0\) is enough information to find the natural system dynamics \(x_*(t)\)
   * If we consider \(x_*(t)\) as an implicit manifold, we can use continuation to track it under parameter changes

** Typical CBC approach
   * Let the system do its own thing; this gives us a start equilibrium
   * Find a controller that stabilises it with zero control action
   * Change a parameter slightly
   * Record what the system now does
   * Update the control target to once again have a zero control action

** Typical CBC approach
   Updating the control target:
   * Set control target to match what the system did
   * Run it under the new controller
   * Repeat until control target = system output
   * This drives control force to zero
     
Under this method, we can track equilibria and limit cycles as a parameter changes!

   * How do we control a neuron when we don't have any model of it?
   * How can we study global bifurcations using CBC?

** Global bifurcations
   * Local bifurcations are those that can be understood entirely from changes in invariant set stability
     * Eg. Hopf, Saddle-Node
   * Global bifurcations are those that can't
     * Eg. homoclinic
   * CBC allows us to track limit cycles and equilibria, but how can we change it to track global bifurcations?
