*** General ***

BarsN 1.0 uses BARS to estimate a mean function from Normal
data. In neuron-firing examples, it estimates the neuron-firing
intensity function.

*** End Files ***


*** Compilation ***

A Makefile has been provided to illustrate compilation. BarsN 1.0
requires the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, both publicly available and
free of charge. You may need to edit the Makefile depending on your
operating system and location of the LAPACK and BLAS libraries.

To use the Makefile as provided, type "make barsN.out" from the linux
prompt in the barsN directory.

[EDIT: gfortran is needed to compile]

*** End Compilation ***





*** Execution ***

To run BarsN using the data in example.data and default parameter
settings:

> barsN.out example.data

To run BarsN using the data in example.data and parameters specified in
example.params:

> barsN.out example.data example.params

To run BarsN using the data in example.data, parameters specified in
example.params, and a user-defined prior on the number of knots
specified in example.prior:

> barsN.out example.data example.params example.prior


*** End Execution ***





*** Data File ***

The data file takes the form of:

*** Parameters File ***

The user may set various parameters by specifying
their values in the optional parameters file.
To set the value of a parameter 'foo' to 'bar',
include the following line in the parameters file.

SET foo = bar


The following parameters are allowed.

parameter: burn-in_iterations
  The number of burn-in MCMC iterations.
  Default value = 0.

parameter: sample_iterations
  The number of sample MCMC iterations
  Default value = 2000.

parameter: Use_Logspline
  This parameter is not currently used and its value has no affect.
  Default value = true.

parameter: initial_number_of_knots
  The number of initial interior knots used. Backwards elimination
  follows, so a large value such as 25 is recommended.
  Default value = 25.

parameter: beta_iterations
  Number of iterations for the independence chain on beta for a
  particular set of knots. It only runs a chain if the initial
  beta variate is suspect. In this case, the independence chain is
  run starting from the mle and only the last variate is used. If
  no beta candidates were accepted, no beta is used although the
  knot set is not rejected.  
  Default value = 3.

parameter: beta_threshhold
  Threshhold for determining whether the initial beta variate is
  suspect. It is suspect if the log acceptance probability is
  less than the threshhold. 
  Default value = -10.0.

parameter: prior_form
  Default value = Uniform.
  Possible values: Uniform, Poisson, User.

  related parameter: Uniform_parameter_L
    Default value = 1.
  related parameter: Uniform_parameter_U
    Default value = MAXKNOTS = 60.
  related parameter: Poisson_parameter_lambda
    Default value = 6.0.

  For k ~ Uniform(L,..,U)
    SET prior_form = Uniform
    SET Uniform_parameter_L = L
    SET Uniform_parameter_U = U

  For k ~ Poisson(M) 
    SET prior_form = Poisson
    SET Poisson_parameter_lambda = M

parameter: proposal_parameter_tau
  Parameter that controls the spread for the knot proposal
  distribution. A candidate knot is generated by first
  selecting a current knot t, 0 < t < 1, and then selecting
  candidate knot ~ beta(t * tau, (1-0) * tau).
  Default value = 50.
 
parameter: reversible_jump_constant_c
  Parameter that controls the probability of 
  birth and death candidates. It may be at most
  0.5.  Larger values increase the probability for birth
  death candidates. Smaller values increase the probability
  for knot relocation.
  Default value = 0.40.

parameter: confidence_level
  The confidence level for parameter intervals.
  Default value = 0.95.

parameter: number_of_grid_points
  The number of evenly spaced points for the grid.
  Default value = 500.

parameter: sampled_knots_file
  The name of the output file for the sampled knot locations.
  Format is 
  [iteration number] [number of interior knots] [knots...]
  Note that the number of entries per line will vary.
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = none.

parameter: sampled_mu_file
  The name of the output file for sampled values of mu 
  on the design points. 
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = samp_mu.

parameter: sampled_mu-grid_file
  The name of the output file for sampled values of mu
  on the evenly spaced grid points. 
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = none.

parameter: sampled_params_file
  The name of the output file for sampled values of
  various parameters. The parameters given are
  iteration number, BIC, log likelihood, location of peak, height at
  peak, number of interior knots.
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = samp_params. 

parameter: summary_mu_file
  The name of the output file for summary values of mu
  on the design points. Three rows are given with
  the x values, posterior mean, and posterior mode,
  respectively.
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = summ_mu.

parameter: summary_mu-grid_file
  The name of the output file for summary values of mu
  on the evenly spaced grid points. Three rows are given with
  the x values, posterior mean, and posterior mode,
  respectively.
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = none.

parameter: summary_params_file
  The name of the output file for summary values of
  certain parameters. The first row is for the location of the
  peak, and the second is for the height, and the third is for the
  number of interior knots. The first two columns are quantiles giving
  a confidence interval for the specified confidence level (see
  parameter confidence_level). The third column is the posterior mean,
  and the fourth is the posterior mode.
  Use "none" to indicate no file.
  Default value = summ_params.

parameter: verbose
  "true" or "false" to indicate verbose output.
  Default value = false.

An example parameters file may contain the following lines of text.

# Start of Example Parameters File

SET burn-in_iterations = 200
SET sample_iterations = 20000
SET initial_number_of_knots = 25
SET beta_iterations = 3
SET beta_threshhold = -10.0
#SET prior_form = Poisson
#SET Poisson_parameter_lambda = 6.0
SET prior_form = Uniform
SET Uniform_parameter_L = 2
SET Uniform_parameter_U = 30
SET proposal_parameter_tau = 50.0
SET reversible_jump_constant_c = 0.40
SET confidence_level = 0.95
SET number_of_grid_points = 150
SET sampled_mu_file = samp_mu
SET sampled_mu-grid_file = none
SET sampled_params_file = samp_params
SET summary_mu_file = summ_mu
SET summary_mu-grid_file = summ_mugrid
SET summary_params_file = summ_params
SET Use_Logspline = true
SET verbose = true

END

# End of Example Parameters File

*** End Parameters File ***


*** Prior File ***

The prior file is only used if prior_form is set to 'User'.  The file
takes the form of:

2 0.05
3 0.15
4 0.30
5 0.30
6 0.10
7 0.10

which indicates that Pr(k=2) = 0.05, .., Pr(k=7) = 0.10. All zero
probabilities that appear between the smallest k having non-zero
probability and the largest k having non-zero probability are changed
to an epsilon > 0. The probabilities are then scaled to sum to one. Be
aware that very low prior probabilites may make it difficult for the
chain to explore some posterior regions that have high posterior
probability. For example, consider Pr(k = 2) = Pr(k=4) = 0.499999, 
Pr(k=3) = 0.000002. The resulting chain would generally get stuck in
either the k = 2 region of the posterior, or the k = 4 region of the posterior.

*** End Prior File ***


*** S wrapper ***

To use the S wrapper included with the program:

First, be sure to compile the barsN program as before, using the
command "make barsN.out".  Next, enter the following commands at the
unix prompt:

> Splus CHAPTER barsN.c

> Splus make

After entering S-plus, type the following commands:

> dyn.open("S.so")

> source("barsN_wrapper")

One also has the option of copying the function directly into S-plus.

The name of the function is barsN.fun.

For precise instructions on using the S wrapper, including inputs and
outputs, please read the comments at the beginning of the file barsN_wrapper.

*** End S wrapper ***
